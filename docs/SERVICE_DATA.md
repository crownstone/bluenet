# Bluenet service data v3.0.0
-----------------------------

The service data contains the state of the Crownstone.

This only documents the latest service data protocol. The old versions are kept up in a separate [document](SERVICE_DATA_DEPRECATED.md).

# Device type and encrypted service data
This packet contains the device type and the state info. If encryption is enabled, the data is encrypted using [AES 128 ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_.28ECB.29) using the service data key.
You can verify if you can decrypt the service data by checking if the validation is the correct value, and if the Crownstone ID remains the same after decryption (while the encrypted service data changes).

## State packet

The following type gives the latest state of the Crownstone.

![Encrypted service data state](../docs/diagrams/service-data-encrypted-state-2.png)

Type | Name | Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
uint 8 | Crownstone ID | 1 | ID that identifies this Crownstone.

#### Switch state
To be able to distinguish between the relay and dimmer state, the switch state is a bit struct with the following layout:

![Switch State Packet](../docs/diagrams/switch_state_packet.png)

Bit | Name |  Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | Relay | Value of the relay, where 0 = OFF, 1 = ON.

<a name="flags_bitmask"></a>
#### Flags bitmask

Bit | Name |  Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | Dimming available | When dimming is physically available, this will be 1.
1 | Marked as dimmable | When dimming is configured to be allowed, this will be 1.
2 | Error |  If this is 1, the Crownstone has an error, you can check what error it is in the [error service data](#service_data_encrypted_error), or by reading the [error state](PROTOCOL.md#state_packet).
3 | Switch locked | When the switch state is locked, this will be 1.
4 | Time set | If this is 1, the time is set on this Crownstone.
5 | Switchcraft | If this is 1, switchcraft is enabled on this Crownstone.
