memory
======

Visualise your linker memory map file using D3.js. Try it out here: [HTML Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/eliotstock/memory/blob/master/index.html)

This has only been tested on a project for the Nordic nRF51822, but should work with any *.Map file produced by the GNU linker, ld.

Pull requests welcome.

Cheers,

Eliot.
